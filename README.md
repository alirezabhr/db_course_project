 - functions_triggers_stored_procedures.sql - Defines any required SQL functions and triggers.
 - domain_type_enum_creator.sql - SQL to create any domain or enum.
 - selections.sql - A collection of sample SQL queries and output using the database.
 
 - data_insertion.sql and choice_data_insertion.sql - Statements to populate the database with sample data.
 - database_backup - A full database backup that can be restored.
 - erd.png - An entity relationship diagram visually modeling the database structure.
